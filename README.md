# Generic Dataset Metadata Template

This project's generic dataset metadata template has been created to satisfy several concrete customer applications:
- the need for a concrete model for delivering metadata to DeIC and DTU organizations 
- delivering data set metadata for existing projects in the wind energy domain
- preparing metadata descriptions for use in GOFAIR M4M workshops that deal with metadata
- Research Data Alliance  activities supporting data set metadata definition (e.g., the Engineering IG)
- COVID-19 Training workshops organized by GO FAIR in support of ZonMV

The template has the following target capabilities:
- compatibility with a well-known generic metadata modeling and collection system (CEDAR)
- evaluation of and support for GO FAIR FAIR Data Points (FDPs)
- support for RDF production that can be presented (with translation) as nanopublications
- satisfaction of FAIR principles and metadata evaluators


The template decription in Google Sheets is intended to provide sufficient detail that it can be used to create a CEDAR Template, 
which in turn can be filled out easily by the dataset creator or contributor. 
The template description in Google Sheets could also be adopted for other metadata systems.

It should be noted that many FAIR principles and FDP specifications can not be satisfied by the data creator/contributor,
but must be addressed by the data aggregator and distributor. 
These differences will be highlighted as we fill out the details of the template specifiction.
